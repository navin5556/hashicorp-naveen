# Lab: What is Infrastructure as Code?

## What is Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is like a blueprint or a set of instructions for managing and deploying IT infrastructure. Instead of manually setting up servers, networks, and other components, IaC allows us to define and automate these processes using code. It's like using a script to create and manage the necessary infrastructure.

## Benefits of IaC

The key benefits of Infrastructure as Code include:

1. Simplifying Cloud Adoption: IaC makes it easier to transition to cloud services, enabling organizations to quickly enhance their capabilities by utilizing cloud-based resources.

2. Automation of Infrastructure Requests: It eliminates the need for many manual steps in requesting and setting up infrastructure. Approved requests can be automated, reducing the time and effort required to fulfill them.

3. Capacity-on-Demand: IaC enables the creation of a library of pre-defined services that developers can easily access and provision as needed. This self-service capability allows for on-demand capacity, matching infrastructure to specific project requirements.

4. Standardization and Consistency: By using IaC, organizations can enforce consistent configurations and standards across their infrastructure. This helps in reducing errors and deviations from established norms, ensuring reliability and efficiency.

In simple terms, Infrastructure as Code is like having a recipe for building and managing your IT infrastructure. It not only makes things faster and more efficient but also ensures that everything is done in a standardized and consistent way.

## Example of IaC

## IaC Tools

The list below represents some of the most popular Infrastructure as Code tools used by many organizations worldwide. These tools focus on deploying infrastructure on a private or public cloud platform. The list does NOT include tools such as Puppet, Chef, Saltstack, or Ansible since those are commonly placed in the configuration management category and don't really deploy infrastructure resources. There are likely other tools available, but they are not as popular as the ones listed below.

- HashiCorp Terraform - terraform.io
- AWS CloudFormation - aws.amazon.com/cloudformation
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) - azure.microsoft.com
- Google Cloud Deployment Manager - cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs
- Pulumi - pulumi.com
